Holo Reader
===========

A simple RSS/Atom reader, available on [Google Play][1].


Requirements
============

To compile Holo Reader you need to provider three libraries:
* [ActionBarSherlock][2]
* [ViewPagerIndicator][3]
* [GooglePlayServices][4]

You'll probably have to adjust your project.properties to point to their location.


API-Access
==========

For security reasons the keys used for Google API access have been removed, so you need to provide your own.
